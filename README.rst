Python implementation of the dgim algorithm: Compact datastructure to estimate the number of "True" in the last N elements of a boolean stream.

Features
--------

* Estimation of the number of "True" statements in the last N element of a boolean stream
* Low memory footprint.
* Tunable error rate (the lower the error rate, the higher the memory footprint)

Applications
------------

When processing large streams of data such as clicks streams, server logs, financial streams.
It is often necessary to maintain statistics about the N latest elements.
If N is big or if you have many streams to process, it is not possible to store
the N latest elements.
In such situations, if the processed stream is made of boolean,
the DGIM algorithm can help you estimate the number of `True` statements
in the last elements.
For instance, if the stream is made of server logs, 
DGIM algorithm can estimate the proportion of visits that come from search engines.
(as opposed to direct access, or access through paid search)


Installation
------------

At the command line::

    $ pip install dgim

Usage
-----

Sample code::

  from dgim import Dgim
  dgim = Dgim(N=32, error_rate=0.1)
  for i in range(100):
      dgim.update(True)
  dgim_result = dgim.get_count() # 30 (exact result is 32)
